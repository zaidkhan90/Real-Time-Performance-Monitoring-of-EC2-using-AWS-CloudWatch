EC2 CPU Monitoring & Alerting Using AWS CloudWatch

This project showcases how to monitor the real-time performance of an Amazon EC2 instance using AWS CloudWatch, with a focus on CPU utilization.
It also demonstrates how to configure a CloudWatch Alarm that flags abnormal usage patterns when a defined threshold is crossed.

🔍 Project Summary

In cloud-based systems, continuous monitoring of compute resources is essential to ensure reliability and performance. 
This implementation leverages AWS’s native monitoring capabilities to track CPU usage on an EC2 instance and detect sudden load increases through automated alarms.

Key Goals:

Metric Monitoring: Capture and visualize CPU utilization data from an EC2 instance.

Threshold-Based Detection: Configure an alarm to detect abnormal CPU consumption.

Operational Awareness: Enable quick identification of performance anomalies using CloudWatch metrics and alarms.

🧰 AWS Services Involved

Amazon EC2: The compute instance under observation (Instance ID: i-08cc5d5881f30226f).

AWS CloudWatch: Used for metric collection, visualization, and alarm configuration.

⚙️ Setup & Configuration

The heart of this project is a CloudWatch Alarm configured to continuously monitor the CPU load of the EC2 instance.
The alarm evaluates CPU behavior over short intervals to ensure timely detection of spikes.

Alarm Settings:

Metric Name: CPUUtilization

Aggregation Method: Average

Monitoring Interval: 1 minute

Trigger Condition: CPU usage ≥ 15%

Evaluation Window: 1 data point (1 minute)

Alarm Actions: None (visual alert only)

📈 Observations & Validation

To validate the setup, artificial CPU load was generated on the EC2 instance. The system responded correctly to the increased resource usage.

Normal Operation (OK State)

Under idle conditions, CPU utilization remained low and consistent. During this phase, the CloudWatch alarm stayed in the OK state,
confirming that the instance was operating within acceptable limits.

Load Increase & Metric Spike

At approximately 13:10, the CPU usage rose sharply from below 5% to more than 60%. This sudden increase clearly exceeded the defined threshold,
as visible on the CloudWatch metric graph.

Alarm Activation

After the CPU utilization stayed above 15% for one full minute, the alarm transitioned from OK to In Alarm at 13:13:27 (local time). 
This confirmed that the alarm logic was working as intended and reacting promptly to performance changes.

🧠 Key Takeaways

This project illustrates how AWS CloudWatch can be used to build an effective monitoring and alerting mechanism with minimal configuration.
Even a basic alarm setup can provide valuable insights into system behavior and help teams respond quickly to unexpected load conditions.

Such monitoring is a foundational practice in cloud operations, enabling proactive troubleshooting, improved system reliability, and better infrastructure management.
